/// This trait provides essential functionality for traversing and querying
/// graph data structures, allowing components to retrieve neighbor information,
/// verify the existence of vertices and edges, and obtain collections of vertices.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// * `T` - The vertex identifier type, which must implement the `VertexId` trait.
/// * `V` - The vertex data type, representing the content or properties of vertices.
#[allow(dead_code)]
